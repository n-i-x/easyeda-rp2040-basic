# easyeda-rp2040-basic
A basic design for the RP2040 without GPIO routing. Based on the RP2040 Minimal design by Raspberry Pi Foundation.

# This project is still WIP. Boards have not been produced using this design yet. Use at your own risk!

All parts are readily available from JLCPCB. The design uses only 2 layers and single sided parts placement so it should be pretty inexpensive to produce. While I've used all these parts in other RP2040 projects, I've never used this exact PCB design in any projects yet.

## How to use
In EasyEDA, open the files and save them to the same project. The PCB does not have a board outline defined. Once they are both saved to the same project, you should be able to modify the schematic/PCB as you see fit.
